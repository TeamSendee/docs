# SMS

Sendee's SMS API helps you add a robust queueing system to your applications.

Using the REST API, you can send single and bulk SMS messages with one API request, and track delivery of sent messages.

### Base URL

All URLs referenced in the API documentation have the following base:

```
https://gosendee.com/api
```

The API is server over HTTPS.  To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.
