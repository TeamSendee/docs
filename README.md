# Introduction

The Sendee API is organized around REST.  Our API uses resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_\(HTTP\)#Use\_for\_submitting\_web\_forms) request bodies, and returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses.

You can use the Sendee API to send single and bulk messages through the Twilio platform using your Twilio credentials.

[api-reference](reference/api-reference/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
